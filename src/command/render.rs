/*
When window coordinates are used, the application performs the coordinate divisions by w, providing
x/w, y/w, z/w, 1/w, s/w, t/w, and q/w as necessary in the vertex structure (only x/w and y/w are
mandatory). Window coordinates may be less than optimal on future hardware that can perform
perspective division and viewport transformations.
When clip coordinates are used, the division by w is performed automatically. The minimal vertex
specifies x, y, and w. If z buffering is enabled, z should be in the range [âˆ’w..+w]; otherwise, z data need
not be given. Glide will automatically compute x/w, y/w, z/w, and 1/w, perform vertex snapping on the
results, and then apply the viewport transformation to get window coordinates. Texture coordinates s
and t are in the range [0..1] for all texture sizes and aspect ratios. Glide automatically computes s/w,
t/w, and q/w.
Clip space coordinates are recommended for all new applications. It is likely that future hardware will
perform the viewport transformation and depth range computations to further off-load the CPU.
